# Python

| Project Link | Completion Date | Libraries | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| üé° [Sentiment Analysis and Topic mModelling for Theme Park Reviews](https://github.com/dk326/Sentiment-analysis-and-Topic-model-for-Theme-park-reviews/blob/main/Dumidu_Kobbekaduwa_MIS780A1.ipynb)| 2024 |Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, NLTK, Statistics, Sklearn |WIP|
| üçΩÔ∏è [Models for Rating and Classifying Indian Restaurants](https://github.com/dk326/Restaurent-Rating-and-Clustering/blob/main/Kobbekaduwa_Dumidu_s220478042_MIS710A2_(1).ipynb)| 2023 |Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn |This project, part of a machine learning assessment, analyzes a dataset of over 40,000 Indian restaurants to identify factors influencing ratings and build predictive models. Three models were developed, with the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model using 10 neighbors performing best, explaining 67% of rating variation using predictors like average cost for two, votes, review ranking, online orders, and table booking. The other models were effective but less accurate. An unsupervised model categorized restaurants into six types based on cost, votes, reviews, and table booking. Insights show table booking is crucial for customer satisfaction, and cost remains a concern|
| ü¶∫ [Road Hazard Classification model](https://github.com/dk326/Identifying-Blackspots-Road-Hazards-/blob/main/Kobbekaduwa_Dumidu_s220478042_MIS710A1.ipynb)| 2023 | Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn | The project was developed to classify road segments as blackspots or not. A blackspot is a section of a road where there is a liklihood of occuring of a fatal accident. A machine learning solution using a logistic regression algorithm was developed using a dataset provided by the client (real data provided by my university). The model developed can classify whether a road segment is a blackspot or not with high accuracy (91%) and precision (68%). The model looks at 8 key features of a road segment.|

# SQL

| Project Link | Area of Analysis | Completion Date | 
|---|---|---|
|üéØ [Donation Trends and Behaviour](https://github.com/dk326/Analysing-Donation-trends-and-engagement-patterns)| The data for this project comes from a nonprofit organization. The analysis aimed to examine donation patterns over time and by product type, as well as donor engagement trends. SQL was utilized for data analysis on the BigQuery platform, and Looker Studio was used for visualizations.| 2024 |
|üë• [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/dk326/Customer-segmentation-and-behaviour-)| The project analyzed customer behavior for an online news provider, comparing gold and non-gold members' communication preferences and spending. It also examined technology usage across segments I created, such as age, tenure, gender, and state, using SQL. | 2024 |
|üõçÔ∏è [RFM analysis](https://github.com/dk326/Product-performance-and-RFM/tree/main)| The project analyzed data from a hypothetical organization selling online news items to address business questions related to customer buying behaviors and product performance. Using the RFM model, customers were categorized into five segments. SQL queries were run on google's bigquery platform. | 2024 |

# PowerBi

| Project Link | Project Description | Comletion Date|
|---|---|---|
|üõ°Ô∏è[Cyber Security Incident Dashboard](https://github.com/dk326/Cyber-Security-Incident-Responses/tree/main)| This project was my first PowerBi dashboard, developed as part of a first-year unit on business intelligence and databases. The project consists of three dashboards to monitor cycber security incidents of a hypothetical organisation. The three dashboards are tailored for different audienceses of the management, analysts and the response team.  | 2023 |
