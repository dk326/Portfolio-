| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| ü¶∫ [Road Hazard Classification model](https://github.com/dk326/Identifying-Blackspots-Road-Hazards-/blob/main/Kobbekaduwa_Dumidu_s220478042_MIS710A1.ipynb)| 2023 | Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn | The project was developed to classify road segments as blackspots or not. A blackspot is a section of a road where there is a liklihood of occuring of a fatal accident. A machine learning solution using a logistic regression algorithm was developed using a dataset provided by the client (real data provided by my university). The model developed can classify whether a road segment is a blackspot or not with high accuracy (91%) and precision (68%). The model looks at 8 key features of a road segment. |
