| Project Link | Completion Date | Libraries | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| üîÆ [Gold price forecasting using an LSTM model](https://github.com/dk326/Gold-Price-Forecasting-Model/blob/main/Dumidu_Kobbekaduwa_MIS780A2_Task3.ipynb)| 2024 |Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow |This project is focused on developing deep learning models to successfully forecast gold prices in USD, leveraging data from six other currencies. The dataset includes daily gold prices from 1985 to 2023, but the model is specifically trained on data from 2010 onwards due to notable changes in gold price patterns since 2006. A deep learning model utilizing LSTM nodes is employed to learn these patterns. Despite its complexity, the model predicts daily gold prices in USD for up to 14 days ahead with a mean absolute error of 38.04 |
| ‚ôªÔ∏è [Waste classification model developed using a CNN model](https://github.com/dk326/Sentiment-analysis-and-Topic-model-for-Theme-park-reviews/blob/main/Dumidu_Kobbekaduwa_MIS780A1.ipynb)| 2024 |Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow |The best performing CNN model is designed to classify six types of waste: cardboard, plastic, paper, metal, glass, and vegetation, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 80%. It performs best with vegetation, correctly identifying it 100% of the time, with only 4% misclassified as other types. However, the model struggles with plastic, showing only 67% accuracy and misclassifying other types as plastic 36% of the time. To improve performance, it is recommended to retrain the model with better images of plastics and to implement human oversight for plastic classification.|
| üè†  [Real Estate Price Estimation using deep learning](https://github.com/dk326/Real-Estate-Price-Estimation-Model/blob/main/Dumidu_Kobbekaduwa_MIS780A2_Task1_.ipynb)| 2024 |Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, TensorFlow |A prediction model has been developed to estimate house prices based on various features, including the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, square footage, house grade, and condition. The dataset has been scaled to a range of 0 to 1 to minimize bias and accommodate differences in scale. The model utilizes numeric variables, as categorical columns have been encoded. It achieves a mean absolute error of 68,382.33, which is satisfactory given the average house price of 535,567.92. However, performance can be enhanced with new data that has less skewness and fewer outliers.|
| üé° [Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modelling for Theme Park Reviews](https://github.com/dk326/Sentiment-analysis-and-Topic-model-for-Theme-park-reviews/blob/main/Dumidu_Kobbekaduwa_MIS780A1.ipynb)| 2024 |Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, NLTK, Statistics, Sklearn |This project analyzes customer reviews from theme parks in California, Paris, and Hong Kong to gain insights into visitor behavior, satisfaction, and concerns. The technical analysis includes sentiment analysis using VADER, text preprocessing (cleaning and tokenizing reviews), and aspect-level sentiment analysis focused on services. Topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was performed to identify key themes and topics in the reviews, like interests (e.g., family trips, magical experiences) and concerns (e.g., waiting times, water availability). The analysis identified patterns in visitor origins and peak times, offering recommendations for management, such as targeted marketing, reducing wait times, and improving services through self-checkouts and hotel partnerships‚Äã|
| üçΩÔ∏è [Models for Rating and Clustering Indian Restaurants](https://github.com/dk326/Restaurent-Rating-and-Clustering/blob/main/Kobbekaduwa_Dumidu_s220478042_MIS710A2_(1).ipynb)| 2023 |Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn |This project, part of a machine learning assessment, analyzes a dataset of over 40,000 Indian restaurants to identify factors influencing ratings and build predictive models. Three models were developed, with the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model using 10 neighbors performing best, explaining 67% of rating variation using predictors like average cost for two, votes, review ranking, online orders, and table booking. The other models were effective but less accurate. An unsupervised model categorized restaurants into six types based on cost, votes, reviews, and table booking. Insights show table booking is crucial for customer satisfaction, and cost remains a concern|
| ü¶∫ [Road Hazard Classification model](https://github.com/dk326/Identifying-Blackspots-Road-Hazards-/blob/main/Kobbekaduwa_Dumidu_s220478042_MIS710A1.ipynb)| 2023 | Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn | The project was developed to classify road segments as blackspots or not. A blackspot is a section of a road where there is a liklihood of occuring of a fatal accident. A machine learning solution using a logistic regression algorithm was developed using a dataset provided by the client (real data provided by my university). The model developed can classify whether a road segment is a blackspot or not with high accuracy (91%) and precision (68%). The model looks at 8 key features of a road segment.|

# SQL

| Project Link | Area of Analysis | Completion Date | 
|---|---|---|
|üéØ [Donation Trends and Behaviour](https://github.com/dk326/Analysing-Donation-trends-and-engagement-patterns)| The data for this project comes from a nonprofit organization. The analysis aimed to examine donation patterns over time and by product type, as well as donor engagement trends. SQL was utilized for data analysis on the BigQuery platform, and Looker Studio was used for visualizations.| 2024 |
|üë• [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/dk326/Customer-segmentation-and-behaviour-)| The project analyzed customer behavior for an online news provider, comparing gold and non-gold members' communication preferences and spending. It also examined technology usage across segments I created, such as age, tenure, gender, and state, using SQL. | 2024 |
|üõçÔ∏è [RFM analysis](https://github.com/dk326/Product-performance-and-RFM/tree/main)| The project analyzed data from a hypothetical organization selling online news items to address business questions related to customer buying behaviors and product performance. Using the RFM model, customers were categorized into five segments. SQL queries were run on google's bigquery platform. | 2024 |

|---|---|---|---|
|üëë[Profitability Dashboard for Burrito King](https://github.com/dk326/Profitability-Dashboard-for-the-Chief-Marketing-Officer/tree/main)| This project was done as an assessment for the unit descriptive analytics. A dashboard is developed for a restaurant chain called burrito king. The target audience is the chief marketing officer. The purpose of the dashboard is to monitor profitability of products through different regions in Australia. The data was provided by my university. | Tableau, Wordpress | 2023|
|üõ°Ô∏è[Cyber Security Incident Dashboard](https://github.com/dk326/Cyber-Security-Incident-Responses/tree/main)| This project was my first PowerBi dashboard, developed as part of a first-year unit on business intelligence and databases. The project consists of three dashboards to monitor cycber security incidents of a hypothetical organisation. The three dashboards are tailored for different audienceses of the management, analysts and the response team.  | Power Bi | 2023|
